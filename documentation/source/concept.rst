Concept
=======
This first pre-release of Peresvet does not include Peresvet's functionality as such.  

Main goal of it is to explore functionality of modern TSDBs, visualization tools, and to start and adjust a couple of related GitHub projects.

...So, thanks to some prior analisys these tools was chosen:

#. `VictoriaMetrics <https://victoriametrics.com/>`_ as TSDB, 
#. `Grafana <https://grafana.com/>`_ as visualization.
